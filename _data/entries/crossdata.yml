description: |
    Crossdata is a distributed framework and a data layer that unifies the interaction with batch and streaming sources supporting multiple datastore technologies
    thanks to its generic architecture and a custom SQL-like language with support for streaming queries. Supporting multiple architectures imposes two main challenges:
    how to normalize the access to the datastores, and how to cope with datastore limitations. To access multiple technologies Crossdata defines a common unifying interface
    containing the set of operations that a datastore may support. New connectors can be easily added to increase its connectivity capabilities. Two types of connectors are
    defined: native and spark-based. Native connectors are faster for simple operations, while Spark-based connectors offer a larger set of functionality.
    The Crossdata planner decides which connector will be used for any request based its characteristics. Offer a
    shell, Java/REST APIs, and ODBC for BI.
