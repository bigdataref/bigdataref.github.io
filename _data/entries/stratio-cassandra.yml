description: |
    Stratio Cassandra is a fork of Apache Cassandra where index functionality has been extended to provide near real time search such as ElasticSearch or Solr, including
    full text search capabilities and free multivariable search. It is achieved through an Apache Lucene based implementation of Cassandra secondary indexes,
    where each node of the cluster indexes its own data. Stratio Cassandra is one of the core modules on which Stratioâ€™s BigData platform (SDS) is based.
