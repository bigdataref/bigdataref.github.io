description: |
    Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log. Kafka is designed to
    allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and
    transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow
    data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers.
    Kafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers strong durability and fault-tolerance guarantees.
