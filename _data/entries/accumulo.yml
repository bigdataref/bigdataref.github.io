    Apache Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.
    Apache Accumulo features a few novel improvements on the BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control
    and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in the data management
    process. Other notable improvements and feature are outlined here.
