description: |
    Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based
    MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications. The Spark engine runs in a variety of environments,
    from cloud services to Hadoop or Mesos clusters. It is used to perform ETL, interactive queries (SQL), advanced analytics (e.g. machine learning) and streaming over
    large datasets in a wide range of data stores (e.g. HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, S3). Spark supports a variety of popular development languages including Java, Python and Scala.
