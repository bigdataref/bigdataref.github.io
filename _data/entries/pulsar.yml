description: |
    An open-source, real-time analytics platform and stream processing framework. Pulsar can be used to collect and process user and business events in real time,
    providing key insights and enabling systems to react to user activities within seconds. In addition to real-time sessionization and multi-dimensional metrics
    aggregation over time windows, Pulsar uses a SQL-like event processing language to offer custom stream creation through data enrichment, mutation, and filtering.
    Pulsar scales to a million events per second with high availability. It can be easily integrated with metrics stores like Cassandra and Druid.
