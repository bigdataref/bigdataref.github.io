description: |
    Apache HBase is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store. Use Apache HBase when you
    need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables
    -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is an open-source,
    distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
    Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google
    File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
