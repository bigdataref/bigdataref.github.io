    Neo4j is a Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of
    a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible
    network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables — yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database.
    For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.
